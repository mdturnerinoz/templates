This series of C++ template usage (Platforms) is based on a web article at
http://altdevblogaday.com/2011/06/27/platform-abstraction-with-cpp-templates/ entitled
"Platform Abstraction with C++ Templates" by Michael Tedder. I thought it'd be fun to
place his example code on github so I (and others) could play with this and thus learn
better how C++ templates work (something I'm at present somewhat weak in the 
understanding of).

For the present, only the "platforms" project exists; as I get more "into" C++ templates
I'll add more so we can all understand these beasties better.  ;0)

Hope it's useful to you as it was to me!
